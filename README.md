# CRUD Demo - the Backend API #

This is the backend of two apps - this API built in  .NET 4.7 handling the JWT and SQL needed by
an HTML5 frontend built in VueJs 3, Vite, Pinia paired with SQL and so forth.

The frontend: https://demo.northberry.net/

## Backend Notes ##

I added class libraries to separate out the various functionality - jwt, crypto, users, data.  
It was an exercise in "let's build everything from first principles - ground up" - so I won't
try to suggest that my approach was superior.  (My approach certainly was not superior when it came to my data model - more on that later.)
